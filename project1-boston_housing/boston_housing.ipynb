    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

This is due to heavy overfitting (the decision tree is flexible enough to explain a handful of training points).

It seems to converge slowly to a value around 0.8.\n",

    "testing curve: for very few training points, the testing curve is at or close to 0. This is due to heavy overfitting (the decision tree explains the few training points perfectly but these are not representative of the population). The testing curve then goes up quickly and converges to a value slighly below the training curve. This indicates good generalization.\n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."
   ]

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "**Answer: ** When max-depth=1, it suffers from high bias because both training and validation scores are low, hence the model underfits. When max-depth=10, it suffers from high variance because the training score is high but validation score decreases, hence the model overfits. "

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "**Answer: **: When evaluating different settings (“hyperparameters”) for estimators, such as the C setting that must be manually set for an SVM, there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called “validation set”: training proceeds on the training set, after which evaluation is done on the validation set, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by partitioning the available data into three sets, we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is a procedure called k-fold cross-validation. A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is trained using k-1 of the folds as training data;\n",
    "the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).\n",
    "The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as it is the case when fixing an arbitrary test set), which is a major advantage in problem such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small."

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "Age of dataset: The age of the dataset may render some features of the model useless for estimations today. For instance, the imporatance of the pupil/teacher ratio may decrease in time. The theory is: the pupil/teacher ratio in the neighborhood drives demand for houses in the area (and thereby house prices) if families rely on local schools for their kids' education. Let's say this has been so in 1978. However, if people nowadays are more flexible when choosing schools, this effect could vanish. 3 minutes of googling delivered this researcher (http://sites.duke.edu/urbaneconomics/?p=863) who claims Charter schools are getting more popular in the US. The effect supposedly is that pupils are not limited to local schools anymore. If this is true, our model may overemphasize the effect of PTRATIO today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of features: we have only used 3 of 14 available features. It may be good to explore others as well. For instance, there is another feature (called DIS) in the dataset which gives a weighted distance to one of 5 employment centers in Bosten (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). I can easily image this feature to have a large impact on price. When I searched for my flat, I also accepted higher prices to be close to the city center where I work. I strongly suspect houses closer to employment centers are more in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness: Looking at the sensitivity analysis above, we can see that the 10 trials delivered estimates ranging from 302,400.00 USD to 420,622.22 USD, two values more than 100k apart. With an average price of little more than 400k and a such a large variance in estimates, the model is hardly usable. For people buying or selling a house, it will make a huge difference whether the price is 300k or 400k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generelizability to other cities/areas: House prices in Boston are likely not the same as in rural areas. For Germany, I can tell for sure there is a large difference between urban and rural house prices. I expect the same to be true for the US. Thus, the price level will be completely different, suggesting that urban vs. rural should be a feature for itself. Features may also have different effects in rural areas. For instance, the number of rooms probably correlates strongly with the size of a house. If the cost per square meter in urban areas is larger than in rural areas, the positive effect of number of rooms should also be larger in urban areas. Moreover, some features in our model may not even make sense in rural areas. For instance, PTRATIO may not be defined in a very rural area if people go to a school in a different town (no school -> no pupil / teacher ratio)."
